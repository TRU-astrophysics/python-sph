Simple Smooth Particle Mesh implementation in Python

This project is an astrophysically-oriented implementation of a generic smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) algorithm in Python. The algorithm is largely based on Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (2010) by Peter Cossins and Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics and Magnetohydrodynamics (2010) by Daniel Price.
