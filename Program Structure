Pyfluid
library of functions

implementing the leapfrog method for calculating the position, velocity and energies

static_smoothlength_sim function calls the static_smoothlength_leapfrog method which calls the density_arr, pressure_arr, acceleration_arr, energy_evolve_arr functions

density_arr takes in two arrays, one for position and the other for the smoothing lengths, then calls the density function which calculates the density

pressure_arr

acceleration_arr

energy_evolve_arr




Pyfluidex2d_static_h
simulation with nonvariable smoothing length


pyfluid2d_var_h
simulation with variable smoothing length
