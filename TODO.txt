Second step: Check energy conservation
**************************************
We already output positions, velocities and energies.
Add code to output "phi" from the code every so often.
Use this and equations 3.135 and 3.118 to check that energy is being conserved
(Use smaller and smaller time-steps).

3.135: E = SUM_j(m_j*(1/2 vj * vj + u_j + 1/2 Phi_j))

3.118: Phi_i = G SUM_j*(mj * phi(ri - rj, epsiloni))


I would like to refactor the code into different libraries for ease of reading, I am thinking something like:
	1) Physical quantities: r, v, E, density, etc
	2) Simulation requirements: Pi, xi, zeta, omega
	3) Numerical Methods: Leapfrog integrator, RK integrator, etc
